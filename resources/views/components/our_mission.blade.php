                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">🌍 Environmental Impact</h2>
                <p>Every piece of clothing has a footprint, from the water and pesticides used in growing cotton, to the energy consumed in manufacturing and shipping. By choosing second-hand, you are actively reducing the demand for new production, decreasing your carbon footprint, and ensuring fewer items end up in landfills. It's a sustainable choice for the planet.</p>
